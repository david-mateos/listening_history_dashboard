# Listening History Dashboard
This R (technically R markdown but we all know that's just formatting) script uses json files from a data request from Spotify to generate a clean flexdashboard. 

Request data at https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/ to populate the dashboard with your own listening history.
My delivery time for these files was about 4 days. 

Feel free to ignore the markdown in the About section as that is specific to my own data. 

Dashboard should look like this:
